# Building on Windows

The Rust executable serves an embedded browser status client and a versioned WebSocket interface. Radio functionality is not implemented.

The root Cargo workspace contains the station-server package in `server/`. Run Cargo commands from the repository root; the shared lock file and toolchain stay there, and Windows build artifacts remain under `target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/`. The `client/` files are embedded at Rust compile time, without a frontend build step.

## GitHub Actions

[Windows Rust](https://github.com/SensorsIot/wsjtx-rust/actions/workflows/windows-rust.yml)
is a manual alternative, started explicitly from the Actions page. Pushes and pull
requests do not trigger it. Normal development, the full test suite and release packaging
run on the Windows PC; a local pass is not automatically repeated on GitHub.

The workflow uses a GitHub-hosted Windows Server 2022 x64 runner with the MSVC build tools. It installs Rust 1.99.0, matching `rust-toolchain.toml`, and checks formatting, Clippy warnings, tests, release compilation, and execution of the built program. The executable is uploaded as the `wstx-rust-windows-x64` artifact with a 14-day retention period.

No radio, sound device, third-party decoder or repository secrets are required. Rust dependencies implement HTTP/WebSockets, asynchronous networking, JSON and TLS. Node 24 test dependencies provide a real Chromium browser, independent WebSocket peer and disposable TLS certificates. The workflow runs browser tests against the compiled release executable. These checks validate status communication, not FT4/FT8 behavior.

The workflow has read-only repository permissions and pins its checkout and artifact actions to specific commits. It does not publish GitHub releases or packages.

## Local Windows development

Install Rust through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools with the Desktop development with C++ workload and a Windows SDK. The toolchain file selects the compiler version automatically.

The local pre-push gate is the authoritative check:

```powershell
python harness/core/tools/gate.py
```

It selects the affected compiler checks and automated suites, including the full
communication suite with its 60-second bandwidth measurement. The ordinary push hook
uses the same gate and its valid memoized results. Do not repeat the individual checks
below when the gate has already supplied their evidence for the same candidate.
Release packaging also runs on this PC; start the packaged candidate for the dry run.

From the repository root:

```powershell
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked --all-targets --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo build --workspace --locked --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
./target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/wstx-rust.exe
```

The server stays running. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in a browser; stop the server
with Ctrl+C. Remote TLS and access settings are defined in the
[communication contract](COMMUNICATION.md#connection-and-security).

For automated browser tests, install Node 24 and run from the repository root:

```powershell
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npx playwright install chromium
cargo build --locked
npm test
```

This is the same full suite selected by the local gate, including the bandwidth test.
Use the standalone command for targeted development or when that evidence is missing;
it is not an extra mandatory run after a successful gate. The manual GitHub workflow
remains an alternative execution location for this full recipe when explicitly chosen.

`WSTX_TEST_EXE` optionally selects an exact packaged executable. Otherwise tests use
the debug executable under `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` when set, or `target/`.
Screenshots and the thin-link measurement report are written to ignored `test-results/`.
The portable link simulator uses modelled network overhead, not packet capture;
see the [measurement limits](COMMUNICATION.md#thin-link-budget-and-test-model).

## Same-machine development

Both applications can be developed on one Windows computer: the station-server process runs locally and the operator client opens in a browser on that computer. The interface between them remains the same when the server is later placed beside a remote radio. The current page reports server version, connection status and an unconfigured radio; it reconnects after connection loss.
